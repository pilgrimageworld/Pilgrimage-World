            Founded in 2003 by Sarah Johnson, a seasoned traveler with a passion
            for sacred sites, Pilgrimage World began with a simple idea: to make
            spiritual journeys accessible to all.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            What started as a small agency organizing trips to Santiago de
            Compostela has grown into a global network serving thousands of
            pilgrims annually. Our team of experts now curates journeys to over
            100 sacred destinations worldwide.
